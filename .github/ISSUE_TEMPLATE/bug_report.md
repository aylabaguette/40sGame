-Had an issue displaying a sprite/texture on the screen, realized that my code was working the whoel time just was sized wrong so it was dispalying but off the screen?!
-had an issue with a textureRect and resizing the image/sprite/texture within it, tried to do it within the code a bunch and was having issues with that, realized there's something called expand mode within the inspector and if you click "fit width" it gets to the size we want!

Additional information?
